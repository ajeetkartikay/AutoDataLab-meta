# AutoDataLab++

## My Contributions

This was a team hackathon project. My specific contributions:

- **HR / Email subenvironment** — `subenvs/email/` and `ceo_brief_env/experts/hr.py`. Built the blended grader (45% structure + 45% tone + 10% audience bonus) and wired it into all 6 tasks.
- **Deployment & ops** — HF Space deployment to `kartik1230/round2-1`, Dockerfile fixes (uvicorn CMD, removing torch from prod deps), Git LFS migration to handle binary files.
- **Validation infrastructure** — `validate_submission.py --base-url` flag for live-mode validation, GitHub Actions CI workflow, session cap with `AUTODATALAB_MAX_SESSIONS` env var, `torch.load(weights_only=True)` security hardening.
- **Reproducible build** — Generated real `uv.lock`, removed training group from `pyproject.toml` to keep prod image small.
- **Documentation** — This README, [`Blog.md`](./Blog.md), and the judge runbook in [`SPACE_README.md`](./SPACE_README.md).

Sai Kamal Nannuri owned the environment architecture, the GRPO training pipeline, the CoS policy training, and the office UI.

A multi-agent OpenEnv environment where a **Chief of Staff (CoS)** policy routes work across four AI specialists — **Data Analyst**, **Finance**, **Strategy**, and **HR** — to complete realistic CEO briefing tasks. We trained **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** with **GRPO** to be that CoS, and added **RAG** over a corpus of company SOPs, policies, and exemplar memos.

## The Problem

Most LLM benchmarks test single-turn reasoning. Real enterprise work isn't like that. A CEO doesn't ask one question; they ask "look at our data, project the quarter, recommend an action, and draft the memo." That requires routing decisions — which expert to consult, in what order, when you have enough information, when to stop iterating, when to commit.

Next-token training rewards plausible-sounding text. **It does not reward stopping.** Our hypothesis: a small LLM trained with RL on the routing decision will outperform a much larger LLM that's just prompted to orchestrate.

## How the Environment Works

### Action space (small + discrete = trainable)
consult(expert_id)   # expert_id in {analyst, finance, strategy, hr}
ask(expert_id, sub_question_id)
summarize()
submit()
noop()
### Observation space

Typed Pydantic CoSObservation with task_name, instruction, consulted_experts, expert_reports, current_brief, data_quality_score, issues, step_count, max_steps, reward_breakdown.

### Tasks (6 total)

| Task | Difficulty | Strategy required? |
|---|---|---|
| easy_brief | easy | No |
| medium_brief | medium | Yes |
| hard_brief | hard | Yes |
| expert_brief | hard | Yes |
| risk_brief | hard | Yes |
| crisis_brief | hard | Yes |

### Reward shaping

- +0.08 per productive consult of a required expert
- +0.02 for a useful summarize
- -0.05 for redundant consults
- -0.02 per step (efficiency pressure)
- Terminal grader score in (0.001, 0.999) on submit, weighing brief content quality, HR memo structure + tone, and strategy rubric grounding

### The four specialists

- Data Analyst — wraps subenvs/autodatalab/analytics.py: cleaning, KPIs, revenue derivation, data-quality scoring
- Finance — deterministic projection / variance / break-even tools
- Strategy — produces 3-bullet operating plans with citations to upstream numbers
- HR / Comms — wraps subenvs/email/: drafts memos, scored on a blended structure + tone + audience rubric

## The Training

Base model: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Method: GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) via Hugging Face TRL. Rollouts collected against the live HF Space env. The policy was warm-started with SFT on demonstration trajectories, then RL'd against the shaped reward.

A 1.5B model is small enough to fine-tune on a single GPU but large enough to follow the JSON action schema. The whole point is to show that a small RL'd policy beats a large prompted-only one on routing.

Reproduce: open [training/cos_grpo_colab.ipynb](./training/cos_grpo_colab.ipynb) in Colab and run end-to-end.

## RAG

The memory/ package contains company SOPs, policies, and exemplar memos. A BM25 retriever (deterministic, no neural embeddings) pulls the top-k passages most relevant to each expert's working query. With RAG ON, experts ground their answers in retrieved snippets and emit memory_citations alongside their reports. Across all 6 evidence rollouts, RAG ON adds ~+0.01 to terminal scores consistently.

## Results

### Terminal scores (3 hard tasks, 4 conditions)

| Task | Base LLM (no RAG) | Base LLM + RAG | Base + GRPO (no RAG) | Base + GRPO + RAG |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| expert_brief | 0.8827 | 0.8925 | 0.8827 | 0.8925 |
| risk_brief | 0.8839 | 0.8948 | 0.8839 | 0.8948 |
| crisis_brief | 0.8805 | 0.8914 | 0.8805 | 0.8914 |

Terminal scores look identical — but only because the env's fallback path completes missing experts before grading.

### What the policy actually did — the real difference

| Dimension | Base LLM (no RL) | Base LLM + GRPO |
|---|---|---|
| model_routed_required | 3 of 4 experts | All 4 experts |
| needed_fallback | True (every run) | False (every run) |
| Action repetition | Spam-consults strategy 4x in a row | Clean linear path |
| Action sequence | analyst -> finance -> strategy -> strategy -> strategy -> strategy | analyst -> finance -> strategy -> hr -> summarize -> submit |

The base LLM never figures out HR is required — it picks the most "interesting" option (strategy) and keeps picking it until the env's fallback force-completes the missing experts.

The GRPO-trained CoS picks all four required experts in the optimal order, summarizes when ready, submits, terminates. Six steps. No fallback. Raw evidence in training/exports/.

If we removed the env's fallback, the base LLM would hit max-steps with an incomplete brief. The RL policy would still complete cleanly. That's the real result.
